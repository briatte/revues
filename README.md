Scripts to process author information from [Cairn.info](http://www.cairn.info/) journals.

# HOWTO

Run `make.r` to replicate in full:

* `data.r` processes the raw data
* `plots.r` produces various concentration rankings
* `networks.r` produces network plots and measures
* `pca.r` produces cluster plots and measures

The code currently runs on sociology journals.
